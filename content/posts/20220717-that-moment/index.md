Recently I was sitting in front of my laptop looking for the inspiration to build something new. In the last few months, I struggled to find the energy to put myself again in front of a keyboard after work. I always loved to spend some of my free time in that way: learn new technology, use it to build something, and share it. But something was not working anymore.

At that moment, I realised I was forcing myself to do it. I didn't enjoy it.

**This realisation left me with a sense o emptiness**.

Time to make a disclaimer: I still like (_like_, not _love_) what I do for a living. Writing code and building software put me in a space where I am comfortable. I am still excited to be able to create something typing on my keyboard. **But the act of building software through code is not giving me a sense of accomplishment**.  
You can use any cool technology, programming language, or framework. But in the end, the technical challenges are always the same. **Everything feels like applying an existing solution to a known problem**.

Since I finished my PhD and joined the industry, I have felt out of place. I kept moving from one company to another, hoping to find my place.  
But in this research, **I have lost sight of my real purpose**.  
I love to solve problems. I love to understand how things work. I love technology. That is why I chose Computer Engineering in the first place and the reason I got into the PhD school. **Code and software were some means to an end**. They were not the final goal. But during my career, I ended up inside a vortex that pushed me to focus more and more on it.

**Now I want to get back on track**.

I won't spend my free time anymore trying out new technologies for the sake of it. Unless they are helpful to a goal, it is a waste of time. If I don't use them daily, I will forget them anyway.  
**I will focus on the foundations of specific technologies**. The reason is that I love to understand their internals, and they won't go anywhere. It will make me a better professional for sure.  
I will still work on some projects, **but only if it is something that will solve a problem that I have**. I won't put much emphasis on the technologies but on the general design of the system and how it solves my problem.

It is more complex when it comes to my career. I still have to understand the right direction to take, but **my goal will be to focus more on solving problems and less on writing code**.

Anyway, that is for another time. Now it is time to enjoy some vacation! ðŸŒ´
