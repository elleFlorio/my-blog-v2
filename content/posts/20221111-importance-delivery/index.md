In the early years of my career, I always focused on delivering a _perfect_ product. I wanted my code to be maintainable, easily extensible, performant, and generic enough to be reused for undefined use cases. 
I thought that was the way to be a great engineer.   
I couldn't be more **wrong**.

What I learned with more experience is that:  
ðŸ¥‰ Poor engineers write dirty code.  
ðŸ¥ˆ Good engineers write _perfect_ code.  
ðŸ¥‡ Great engineers write code that is _good enough_.  

It can sound counterintuitive: why is _good enough_ better than _perfect_ ? ðŸ¤”  
The reason is that what matters is to deliver **what is required**, nothing more and nothing less. 

There is no point in wasting time and resources to make something more than what is required. It is more important to deliver something that brings value to the business **now** and can be improved later **if needed**. ðŸ“ˆ

I want to be clear that I am not advocating for writing dirty code. I am neither underestimating the value of maintainability nor reusability. Don't let me even start with the importance of performance.  
But all of that comes with a **trade-off** compared to time and effort.

The goal is to understand where to set the bar for _good enough_. And it can be **very hard**, more than spending days making the code _perfect_.  
Great engineers can identify **what matters** and set the bar for _good enough_ effectively.

Great engineers know that delivering a _good enough product_ is better than not delivering a _perfect_ product. ðŸ”¥
